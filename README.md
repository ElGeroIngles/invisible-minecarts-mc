The original concept was developed by [Misode](https://discord.com/channels/154777837382008833/157097006500806656/678727705964838912) and then edited by [thederdiscohund](https://discord.com/channels/154777837382008833/157097006500806656/1082828169037496380), this repository could be considered a fork of [thederdiscohund](https://discord.com/channels/154777837382008833/157097006500806656/1082828169037496380)'s edit.

## Usage

When summoning a minecart that you want to make it invisible just summon it with the `invminecarts.invisible_minecart` tag:
```mcfunction
summon minecart ~ ~ ~ {Tags:[invminecarts.invisible_minecart]}
```

The rest of the minecarts will have their texture. This works with all types of minecarts:

- Normal minecart
- Hopper minecart
- Furnace minecart
- Chest minecart
- Tnt minecart
- Command block minecart
- Spawner minecart

## Unistall

To revert the changes run:

```mcfunction
function invminecarts:cmd/unistall
```

After that, all minecarts will be restored and you can now remove the datapack and resourcepack.

**Warning**
If you want to use it again you will first need to run:
 ```mcfunction
 tag @e remove invminecarts.not_this_minecart
 ```
 This is because after unistalling it, the datapack will try again to modify all minecarts to make them invisible (because it is a tick function) so to ignore the minecarts it gives them a tag, so for the datapack to work again you need to remove it.
